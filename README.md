Instructions:
Simply click the green start flag to run the program, use the key slider to set the offset algorithm and press either [E] to encode or [D] to decode the entered text via a pop up when prompted. If nothing is entered then an example text will be submitted, use the turbo function to speed up the process.

Pinball.sb
----------

Project Author: Franz Ayestaran

Created: 14th November 2015 
Updated: 29th November 2015

Description:
An interactive pinball game that starts a ball rolling, enabling the player to collect points on the way. The blue and yellow bumpers light up whenever the ball is close, rebounding it back in the opposite direction at a randomised angle. The player can deflect the ball with the aid of a power paddle positioned just above the red zone. The game ends when the ball lands on the red zone at the bottom of the stage. The project includes sampled sounds from a real Pinball machine.

Instructions:
Simply click the green start flag to run the program. Use the arrow keys to move the power paddle left and right.
